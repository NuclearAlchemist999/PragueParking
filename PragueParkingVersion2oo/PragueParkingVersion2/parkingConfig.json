// Change the number of parking spots here or size and then go to the console menu and choose option 9
// if you want to change the settings and keep the data or 10 if you want to reset the settings.
// If you choose option 9 you can only decrease the size on current spots or have them as they are but
// only if they are empty. Only new spots can have a bigger space. You cannot remove current spots if 
// they have any vehicle. Price or vehicle types however does not have to be applied in the console.
// Just set the values here and they will change automatically. For instance if you erase MC here, you
// cannot add any MC in the program. Change the values here before you start the program.
